# Implicit-Differentiation
Most functions that we have worked with so far have been defined explicitly; that is, we've had an explicit formula for the function such as f(x)=x^3-9x+4 or y = sin(x)+ln(x). These explicit formulas clearly show the relationship between x and y by way of the formula. However, some relationships between x and y are only implied by an equation.  For example, we could solve the equation (x^2)y=4 for y to get y = 4/(x^2).  In this example, y = 4/(x^2) is the explicit formula for y, whereas (x^2)y=4 implicitly defines the relationship between x and y.

To find dy/dx for this equation,
